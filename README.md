# Neural Network Library

This is a simple neural network library implemented in C++ from scratch. It supports the construction of fully connected feedforward neural networks with customizable layers, activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers.

## Features
- Customizable Neural Network Architecture
  - Add layers with different input and output sizes.
  - Specify activation functions for each layer.
- Supported Activation Functions
  - ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
  - Sigmoid
  - Softmax
- Loss Functions
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Cross-Entropy Loss
 - Optimizers
  - Gradient Descent
- Matrix Operations
  - Fully implemented matrix operations, including:
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Element-wise operations and broadcasting.
- Training
  - Forward and backward propagation.
  - Gradient-based optimization.
  - Real-time loss monitoring during training.
